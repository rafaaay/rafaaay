### Hi there, I'm Rafay 👋

- 🧑 I’m a front-end developer who loves to take on visual challenges.
- 🌱 I’ve a strong inclination towards the design, and I'm planning to go back to the university to study it.
- 👨‍💻 I normally work on big e-commerce applications on my full-time job. But personally I love to work on smaller projects that have cool design and aesthetics.
- 👯 I like to collaborate on welfare projects.
- 📫 Here is how you can reach me (sorry still figuring out how to create a github profile lol)
- ⚡ Fun fact: All I ever wanted to do was dig dirt (be an archaelogist). But here I am. I love doing what I do though .
